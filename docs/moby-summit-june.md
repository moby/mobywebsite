### Moby Summit

The Moby Summit is a small collaborative event taking place on _Monday 6/19/17 at Docker HQ in San Francisco_. This summit is for advanced container users who are actively maintaining, contributing or generally involved in the design and development of the Moby Project and it's components: LinuxKit, Infrakit, SwarmKit, HyperKit, DataKit, VPNKit, Notary, libnetwork, etc.

This will be a great opportunity for everyone attending the summit to learn, hack, collaborate and give feedback to drive the architectural decisions and roadmap behind the moby project and it's components.
